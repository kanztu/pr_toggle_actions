name: 'Dockerfile Linter'
description: |
  A smarter Dockerfile linter that helps you build [best practice][] Docker
  images. The linter is parsing the Dockerfile into an AST and performs rules
  on top of the AST. It is standing on the shoulders of [ShellCheck][] to lint
  the Bash code inside `RUN` instructions.
